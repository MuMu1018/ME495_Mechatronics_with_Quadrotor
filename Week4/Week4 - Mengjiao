Week4a.We completed all tasks on class:- We combined complementary filter from last week with our code.- We implemented PWM control of 2 roll motors.  - We made both roll motors spin clockwise.  - We made our P controller work good (we use neutral_power = 1250 and P = 5).  - We made roll motors turn off and exit program when:a) Roll absolute values bigger than 30 degreesb) User presses Crtl+Cc) Main loop takes more than 5ms to execute- We added two propellers and made sure them works well.b.1) What went well:   - We finished P controller part easily.   - We combined last week code smoothly.   - We operated everything in safety.2) What did not go well:    - At the beginning, we could not control 2 roll motors well. They could not be turn off smoothly by pressing Ctrl+C at first, and sometimes just one motor would stop while another one keep spinning. Finally, we find that was because we set our PWM value to 0 to turn them off, while it should be 1000.3) What will you change for next class.   - Check tips more carefully.c. - Fan 50%    - Hong 50% We learn and do everything together, and contribute evenly to our job.d.
